# VectorFlow demo made with ReactFlow and FastAPI

Used ReactFlow to imitate VectorShift's interface, which is an integrated framework of no-code, low-code, and out-of-the-box generative AI solutions to build AI search engines, assistants, chatbots, and automation

I'll write more on this soon. For now here are a few snapshots of the interface.

I used Python and FastAPI framework for backend routing logic.
